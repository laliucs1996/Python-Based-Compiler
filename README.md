# Python-Based-Compiler
Python Application that uses a library called PLY to parse and then compile code. It uses lexographical symbols and a tree hierarchy in order to break down the read text file. Then it looks for symbols and then turns into a tree. The tree is then read from the leaves and then the result is determined in the root.
